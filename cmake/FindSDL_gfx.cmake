# - Locate SDL_gfx library
# This module defines
#  SDL_GFX_LIBRARY, the library to link against
#  SDL_GFX_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
#  SDL_GFX_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL_gfxPrimitives.h
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR
# used in building SDL.

# Created by Olivier DOLE. This was copied from the FindSDL_image.cmake 
# module.
#
# Redistribution and use is allowed according to the terms of the BSD license.
# For details see the accompanying COPYING-CMAKE-SCRIPTS file.

# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of 
# SDL_GFX_LIBRARY to override this selection.
